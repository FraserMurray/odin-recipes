    <h4><em>Here is the final product. A Delicious batch of cooked Brownies!</em></h4>

    <p><strong>To make this recipe, you will require the following ingredients:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>120g butter, softened</li>
        <li>75g light brown suger</li>
        <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>180g plain flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>150g dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Once you have gathered the required ingredients, you will follow the steps shown below:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Cream the butter and 
            sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, s
            tir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow 
            for spreading. Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they
             will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm,
             or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
